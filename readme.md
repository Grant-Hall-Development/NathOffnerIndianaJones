# Creating new release
To create a new release and push to both mobile stores take the following steps:
1. Create a new release at [new release](https://github.com/Grant-Hall-Development/NathOffnerIndianaJones/releases/new)
 * Make sure you create a new tag, the tag should look something like "v{major}.{minor}.{patch}" (example: v2.0.0)
2. Target the right branch and give the release a name
3. Go to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Grant-Hall-Development/NathOffnerIndianaJones/actions)
4. Select the store to release
 * For Android select "Release Android"
 * For iOS select "Release iOS"
5. Press "Run workflow"
6. Select the tag you just created
